## Purpose and Vision

Redwood has a vibrant community that we want to highlight as much as possible. Using the [All-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) specifications and CLI, this project allows us to:

- track the Framework, create-redwood-app, and Redwoodjs.com repo contributors
- display the aggregated list of contributors in the [Contributors section](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/README.md#contributors) of the root README.md

## Managing All-Contributors Data

In general, this is a three-part process:

1. Update the three `.all-contributorsrc` file with new contributors
2. Update README.md#Contributors with changes

> When adding contributors, use this "type" key for specific repos:
>
> - ðŸ’»Â (code) == Framework
>
> The "type" is required and we used to differentiate for various repos. But we don't display it.

### Step 1: Check for new contributors and add to `*rc` files

> **NOTE:**
> Do not add [bot] accounts to the files.
>
> Also, members of the Core Team are manually added to the relevant section of #contributors. To avoid duplication, do not add the following profiles to .all-contributorsrc:
>
> - peterp
> - thedavidprice
> - mojombo
> - cannikin
> - jtoar
> - Tobbe
> - RobertBroersma
> - dthyresson
> - dac09
> - aldonline
> - clairefro
> - ajcwebdev
> - forresthayes
> - kimadeline
> - simoncrypta
> - KrisCoulson
> - keithtelliott
> - callingmedic911
> - agiannelli

```js
cd tasks/all-contributors

yarn all-contributors check --config .all-contributorsrc

// For each contributor listed in output, repeat the following:

yarn all-contributors add --config .all-contributorsrc <contributor> code
```

### Step 2: Update the content in README.md#Contributors

```bash
yarn all-contributors generate --contributorsPerLine 5 --config .all-contributorsrc
```

Don't forget to commit and PR changes.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create a script to handle Step 1 (check and add new contributors for each repo)
