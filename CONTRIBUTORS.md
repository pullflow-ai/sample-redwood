## Managing Redwood All-Contributors

Redwood projects (mostly) follow the [all-contributions](https://allcontributors.org/) specification using the `all-contributors` CLI tool. This allows us to:

- track the [Framework](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood), [create-redwood-app](https://github.com/redwoodjs/create-redwood-app), and [Redwoodjs.com](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwoodjs.com) project contributors
- display the aggregated list of contributors

For more information and related code, see ['tasks/all-contributors/README.md'](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/tree/main/tasks/all-contributors/README.md)
