## Contributing

This package doesn't depend on other Redwood Framework packages.
To contribute, you should be familiar with the ESLint package.
Keep in mind that any rules added should not conflict with code formatting
tools (e.g.
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html)).
