- Fix storybook-vite not starting when `auth.ts` contains named imports after `createAuth` (#11593) by @Philzen

This change fixes an issue with our internal storybook mocks. Previous to this you might find that your storybook would fail with an error like:

```
3:49:51 PM [vite] Internal server error: Transform failed with 1 error:
…/web/src/auth.ts:2:9: ERROR: Expected identifier but found ","
  Plugin: vite:esbuild
  File: …/web/src/auth.ts:3:6

  Expected identifier but found ","
  1  |  import { createAuthentication as createAuth } from '@redwoodjs/testing/dist/web/mockAuth.js'
  2  |  import { , createDbAuthClient } from '@redwoodjs/auth-dbauth-web';
     |           ^
  3  |  const dbAuthClient = createDbAuthClient();
  4  |  export const {
```

This was due to a bug in our handling of imports which this change fixes.
