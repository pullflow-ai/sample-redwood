- fix(graphql): Allow including 'File' scalar by default to be disabled (#11540) by @Josh-Walker-GM

As of v8.0.0 a `File` scalar was added to your graphql schema by default. This could be problematic if you wanted to define your own `File` scalar.

With this change it is now possible to disable including this scalar by default. To see how to do so look at the `Default Scalar` section of the `Graphql` docs [here](https://docs.redwoodjs.com/docs/graphql#default-scalars)
