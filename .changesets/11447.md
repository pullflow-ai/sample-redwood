- fix(resolutions): Remove rehackt resolution (#11447) by @Tobbe

The rehackt resolution isn't needed anymore. Apollo Client has updated to rehackt 0.1.0. See https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#3101

Unfortunately this requires our users to manually go and update their resolutions
