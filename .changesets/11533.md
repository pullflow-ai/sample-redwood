- [gh11385] Updated the generated page template (#11533) by @ahaywood

This change alters the default content produced when you generate page with `yarn rw g page`. Previously our generated content contained code that would error out if you had a route parameter in your page - because the link we automatically generated would not contain a value for that parameter.
